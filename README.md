## General Scratchpad 
Spectral samples of lensed SNe are actually growing. Don't know what Pat has in mind with regarding to SN H0pe but with Zwicky, H0pe and Encore, there is a range of diversity in environments, redshifts and potentially wavelength coverage. What should I do to prepare

- Test out the feature inference with spextractor (16geu, Zwicky public spectra)

- Read the NUV papers, e.g. what D. Jones said and what Kate has done 
	+ read Tanja's paper 
-
