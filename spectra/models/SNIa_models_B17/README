### EXPLOSION MODELS

The hydrodynamical inputs correspond to 1.3 days post explosion (DDC
series), 1.0 day post explosion (SCH series), and 1.1 days post
explosion (PDDEL series) in the files named:

<model>_hydro_<time>d.dat

e.g., SCH2p0_hydro_001.000d.dat for the SCH2p0 model at 1.0 day post
explosion. These files contain the ejecta structure of the converged
CMFGEN model at that time (e.g., the temperature corresponds to the
full non-LTE solution computed by CMFGEN).

The file formats are the same as those used for the supernova
radiative-transfer code-comparison initiative (StaNdaRT) of the
SNRadTrans collaboration (Blondin et al. 2022b, A&A 668, A163; see
https://github.com/sn-rad-trans/data1/tree/master/input_models).



### SYNTHETIC SPECTRA

Synthetic spectra are given at each time step between 1.3d and
104.1d post explosion (DDC series; 47 spectra in total); between 1.0d
and 107.55d (SCH series; 50 spectra in total); and between 1.1d and
107.55d (PDDEL series; 50 spectra in total). For the PDDEL1 model the
spectra are only given up until 55.18d post explosion, and for the
PDDEL3 model only until 97.77d post explosion.

All the spectra were binned on a 5-Angstrom scale between 2500 and
25500 Angstroms (i.e., 4601 wavelengths) based on the original
observer-frame calculation, which computes the flux at >80000
wavelengths in the range 2500-25500 A.

Each spectrum follows the naming convention:

<model>_spec_2500_25500_bin5_<time>d.dat

e.g., SCH2p0_spec_2500_25500_bin5_017.580d.dat is at 17.58 days post
explosion. 

The first column gives the (air) wavelength in Angstroms, the second
column gives the corresponding flux at 10 pc in erg/s/cm^2/A (such
that direct integration of the spectra using a given filter bandpass +
corresponding zero point will yield the absolute magnitude in that
filter).
